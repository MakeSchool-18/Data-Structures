### Class 19: Monday, May 8 â€“ Rotating Binary Search Trees

**Topics:**
- [self-balancing binary search trees] with [rotations]: [AVL tree], [splay tree]

**Resources:**
- review Julia Geist's [AVL tree slides] with animations and examples
- read Julia Geist's [AVL tree article] with animations and code samples
- watch MIT's [AVL tree video lecture]
- play with VisuAlgo's [interactive AVL tree visualization][visualgo bst] to follow rotations step-by-step
- play with USF's [interactive AVL tree animations][USF AVL tree]
- play with USF's [interactive splay tree animations][USF splay tree]

**Challenges:**
- implement `AVLNode` class with the following properties and instance methods using [Julia's AVL tree starter code]:
    - `data` - the node's data
    - `left` - the node's left child, if any
    - `right` - the node's right child, if any
    - `parent` - the node's parent, if not the root
    - `height` - the node's height (the number of edges on the longest downward path to a descendant leaf node)
    - `update_height` - recalculate height based on left child's height and right child's height
    - `balance_factor` - return the difference between left child's height and right child's height
- implement `AVLTree` class using `AVLNode` objects with the following properties and instance methods using [Julia's AVL tree starter code]:
    - `root` - the tree's root node
    - `is_empty` - check if the tree is empty
    - `insert(data)` - insert a new node with `data` in order in the tree
    - `search(data)` - check if a node with `data` is present in the tree
    - `retrace_up(node)` - retrace the path from `node` up to the tree's root and perform any rotations necessary to rebalance
    - `rotate_left(node)` - rotate `node`'s right child so `node` becomes its left child
    - `rotate_right(node)` - rotate `node`'s left child so `node` becomes its right child
    - `items_in_order` - return a list of all items in the tree found using in-order traversal
    - `items_level_order` - return a list of all items in the tree found using level-order traversal
- run `pytest test_avl_tree.py` to run [Julia's AVL tree unit tests] and fix any failures
- annotate class instance methods with complexity analysis

**Stretch Challenges:**
- implement splay tree with insert and search operations
- annotate class instance methods with complexity analysis
