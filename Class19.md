### Class 19: Monday, May 8 â€“ Rotating Binary Search Trees

**Topics:**
- [self-balancing binary search trees] with [rotations]: [AVL tree], [splay tree]

**Resources:**
- review Julia Geist's [AVL tree slides] with animations and examples
- read Julia Geist's [AVL tree article] with animations and code samples
- play with VisuAlgo's [interactive AVL tree visualization][visualgo bst] to follow rotations step-by-step
- play with USF's [interactive AVL tree animations][USF AVL tree]
- play with USF's [interactive splay tree animations][USF splay tree]

**Challenges:**
- implement AVL tree with insert and search operations
- annotate functions with complexity analysis

**Stretch Challenges:**
- implement splay tree with insert and search operations
- annotate functions with complexity analysis
