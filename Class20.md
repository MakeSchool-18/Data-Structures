### Class 20: Wednesday, May 10 â€“ Trie & Multiple Key Trees

**Topics:**
- [*k*-ary tree (*n*-ary tree, *m*-way tree)][k-ary tree]
- [trie (prefix tree, radix tree)][trie]
- [self-balancing trees] with multiple keys: [2-3 tree], [B-tree]
<!-- - [space-partitioning] trees: [quadtree], [octree], [k-d tree] -->

**Resources:**
- review Julia Geist's [trie slides] with animations and examples
- read Julia Geist's [trie article] with animations and code samples
- play with USF's [interactive trie animations][USF trie]
- play with USF's [interactive B-tree animations][USF B-tree]

**Challenges:**
- implement 2-3 tree with insert and search operations
- annotate class instance methods with complexity analysis

**Stretch Challenges:**
- implement trie with insert and prefix search operations
- revisit [phone call routing] scenarios 3, 4, and 5 with trie
- annotate class instance methods with complexity analysis
