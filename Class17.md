### Class 17: Wednesday, May 3 â€“ Graph Traversals & Components

**Topics:**
- [graph traversals]: [depth-first search], [breadth-first search]
- graph [connectivity], [connected components], [strongly connected components]

**Resources:**
- review Alex Dejeu, Julia Geist, and William Wold's [graph traversals slides]
- play with VisuAlgo's [interactive graph traversals visualizations][visualgo traversals]
- play with USF's interactive graph traversals animations: [depth-first search][USF DFS], [breadth-first search][USF BFS]
- play with USF's [interactive connected components animations][USF components]

**Project:**
- [trees and mazes] tutorial on Make School's Online Academy

**Stretch Project:**
- implement graph traversals: depth-first search, breadth-first search
- implement an algorithm to find connected components on your graph data set
- annotate functions with complexity analysis
